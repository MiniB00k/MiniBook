                        is a good deal of myths about straight-A students. Cal Newport wrote this book by interviewing
                        some straight-A students in elite universities to let us know their studying techniques and what
                        makes them straight-A students.

                        Arnold Bennett is discussing how to get out of your daily loop. He thinks that time is a miracle
                        that cannot be replaced by something else. <i>“Time can often produce money, but money cannot
                            produce more time, time is extremely limited”</i>.

                <span>About Us<br></span>
                As human beings, all of us love to keep things. I personally have found my joy in keeping coins. Even
                when we started keeping gold and diamonds, we chose to keep them behind locked doors, just to make sure
                no one could take them. And 5,500 years ago, we finally were able to keep and our most precious thing.
                We started holding pencils and keeping our thoughts. What makes them so precious is that, unlike gold,
                no one can prevent us from keeping them or take them from us. <br><br>What I’m trying to do is to bring
                back
                that idea to life, to respect the people who spent their whole life trying to share their stories. I was
                frustrated to hear the “I have no time to read” answer, so our goal is to give you a 5-minute summary of
                their beautiful stories.
