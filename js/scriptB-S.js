    document.getElementById("Summary_content").innerHTML = "&emsp;&emsp;From living their whole life in between the library shelves to sleeping three hours daily, there is a good deal of myths about straight-A students. Cal Newport wrote this book by interviewing some straight-A students in elite universities to let us know their studying techniques and what makes them straight-A students. We will get to recognize more about the effective methods of avoiding this monster called procrastination. Also, explanation for the art of time management, taking notes, handling assignments, and writing papers and essays.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Surprisingly, straight-A students study fewer hours than their peers, but with more efficiency. “Work accomplished = time spent x intensity of focus”, numerous numbers of students forget about this formula causing them to fall into the trap of “pseudo-working” which is spending many hours doing something without focusing, while it can be done in minutes. Being effective, at first, requires time management, which we all hate. In fact, Time management is not about cramming as many tasks as you can in one day. Instead, it’s about making use of every second. To manage your time, you will need to use a list and a calendar daily. Simply jot down every single task you have on your list. Every day morning, start to plan for the day and transfer these tasks in the tie intervals of your day. Don’t keep the tasks in your head and keep your mind clear. Keep the list with you all day in order to jot down all the tasks that encounter you. Be honest with yourself and if you know that studying this math chapter will take 3 hours, don't convince yourself that it will be done in 1 hour. Make sure that your study hours don’t conflict with anything else like a morning walk or eating. It's easy to start telling yourself excuses like “oh, I didn’t finish this task because I was in the bathroom”, so make a work progress journal to check the tasks you’ve done and highlight the ones you procrastinated doing them and keep a short explanation. Those silly excuses won’t convince you if you wrote them down.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;To keep your productivity high, make sure you are having enough food to go on. Don’t eat a lot of unhealthy snacks. You really must know that a little coffee is useful to stay focused, while five cups will just give you creepy red eyes all night. As it’s predictable that you will procrastinate in the tasks you hate, you can avoid that by making a big event to do these tasks. To clarify, you can make this task in a far place, so when you reach this place, you have nothing else to do but the task. Over time, these methods will become a habit that you love.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;When, Where, and How Long should I study? the best time to do your tasks is morning when you are focused, also studying in the morning gives you a chance to party at night. Remember, “Work hard, play hard” is always better than “Work kind of hard, play kind of hard.”  You have to study in an isolated place, which is not, of course, your bedroom. Study in 45-minute intervals and take breaks to refresh your mind.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The fact that one of the most effective methods to start studying is to attend classes and take notes might be the strangest thing you will hear today. It is way better than starting to listen with yourself as professors tell you exactly what you must know. Your notes have to be organized, so don't write all that your professor says. For non-technical courses, like biology or history, take your notes in the question/evidence/conclusion method. It's recommended to note as many problems with answers as possible for technical courses like math and physics. After each class, try to cluster and arrange your notes. Straight-A students work daily on their small assignments to find time for before-exam study.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;While you Now got your book, notes, and reading passages, don’t start studying before asking your professor about the topics the exam will cover and determine the important recourses that will get you ready for the exam. An effective way to study for technical courses is to build problem sets from all your resources. Start solving them on periods and star the ones you couldn’t figure out and look at their answer. In the next studying period, try to solve them again and remove the star if you could solve them.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;You are in the week before the exam, you’ve finished all your studying problem sets, making the final revision. Take another look at the topics covered in the exam and arrange them from the one you are 100% sure you've covered them all, do these topics you still have problems with-start with those ones.";

You get your breakfast ready and start to eat, while observing your clock and make sure it’s not close to 9:00 yet. It’s actually 9:00 now and you are on your seat, getting ready to start your part time slavery.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;17:00, you made it!! It’s time to sit on your cozy couch until it’s bed time. You go to sleep while feeling sad for all that wasted time and you cannot do anything but blaming your low-salary job for REPEATING EVERY DAY IN YOUR LIFE UNTILL YOUR RETIREMINT.<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Arnold Bennett is discussing how to get out of this loop. He thinks that time is a miracle that cannot be replaced by something else. “Time can often produce money, but money cannot produce more time, time is extremely limited”. something that is very great about time is it’s always fair. Doesn’t matter if you are the poorest person on earth or Elon Musk, you will always get your 24 hours of a day. For many people 1/3rd of that time is actually spent in work, so you’ve got about 16 hours. In order to live those 16 hours, you have to set up your own “program”. You have to seek for development in your life and start what you want to do whatever it’s reading, having fun or even having another job. This program should include the day meals and sleeping time. Thought, the problem in this program is that it was made more than 100 Years ago, and the development of Mobile phones, laptops, and social media is not a part of the calculations."
